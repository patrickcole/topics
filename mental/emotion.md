# Mental - Emotion

> Emotional health is mental health

- take care of yourself first! and do it everyday!
- don't take care of yourself alone, reach out to others
- there's no shame is asking for assistance
- don't allow prolonged episodes of frustration or unprocessed emotions to build up
- recognize when you are feeling a certain way and have ways to deal/cope with those emotions
- allow yourself to identify these moments and bring them forefront in your mind, it will help you deal with them
- perhaps something such as breathing exercises can assist
- capture thoughts and emotions in something such as a journal if that works for you. This can help process the feelings (i.e. "get them out of your head and onto the pages")
- can also serve as a log of how you felt over a longer period of time (perhaps useful for someone who's qualified to offer therapy or medication)
- talk it out with those whom you trust (just let them know that you are experiencing a feeling)
- try to take a break and state what emotion is present rather than you "feel" this emotion, being able to separate the emotion from you can be a good mental boost. For example instead of stating "I am angry", state: "Anger is here". It removes it from "you" and places it in the environment.
