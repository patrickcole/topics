# Imposter Syndrome

> That feeling like everyone around you is better or knows more than you do

- Often these feelings are pulled from previous negative experiences.
- Each new topic we need to learn immediately feels like an impossible mountain or hill to climb.
- What we can do to overcome this is to first break the challenge down into smaller manageable chunks and trust ourselves.
- Reach out for help, those whom want to help will step up.
- Sometimes we take the easier path because we feel insecure about our skills. However, if we can learn to level up our knowledge we can tackle any challenge!
- A common belief is that individuals whom are underrepresented in the industry immediately have a sense of imposters syndrome. This can be due to the fact that in many cases those underrepresented individuals don't have others with a relatable perspective.
- A great technique to combat imposter syndrome is to remind yourself of your accomplishments and experiences. You are at this point in your life because of what you've been able to accomplish.
- If you are worried about negative thoughts, consider writing them down in a list format and next to each item, attach a way to combat or resolve these issues. Sometimes by focusing on one thought at a time, one can realize that the thought isn't as important as they seem while in their mind.
