# Mental - Being Humble

- not knowing everything will allow you to learn more new things
- by being humble, you accept that you will never have the answers to the latest "thing" and you'll want to learn it
- have less feelings of entitlement and be less judgemental, therefore a humble developer will work better with others in reviews and discussions
- more of a team player as opposed to a selfish developer
- curiosity means looking for more solutions to unsolved problems
- to be a great leader, one must acknowledge their own mistakes or faults
- being mindful of one's weaknesses can help them delegate tasks to those whom excel
