# How To Learn

- sometimes methods such as "diffused learning" can help remember content greater than using traditional "focused learning"
- "diffused learning" allows your mind to take a break, wander and think about other things whilst still trying to retain knowledge in the learning process
- a common solution to this is the "Pomodoro Technique"
- another method is to utilize the "chunking method" where topics are separated into chunks that form together in a greater topic
- by understanding a little bit of each chunk, all the pieces can be put together for a greater understanding of a topic
- as knowledge of each "chunk" is retained, you can move onto other chunks but you still have an overall picture (with all the other chunks)
- skim over the topic and get a general understanding of what it will cover before spending more time trying to learn a topic
- having the knowledge of a "high-level" view of a topic can help keep things in perspective and help manage time for learning
- review an example of topic being learned
- build your own example using the knowledge you've learned
- repeat the steps until you feel you have a good solid understanding
- don't fall in the trap of overtaking notes or over highlighting things just to memorize
- make bullets or short notes to quickly state what you've learned
- after you've soaked in the content, take a moment to restate the bullet points or short notes to further re-enforce your knowledge
- remember to test yourself as you learn
- it's okay to make mistakes while testing your knowledge, this is why repetition helps it will train your brain, just like exercising a muscle
- don't try to learn everything about a topic at once, spend multiple sessions to learn something
- try to have additional topics that you can jump in-between to practice the process of being able to switch contexts
- this helps train your brain to activate a certain procedure or context on-demand and acquire the knowledge when you need it
- try not to think, "I have to get this done", more like "I will spend x amount of time on this topic", will be less intimidating
- some people prefer using metaphors and analogies to communicate topics
- after learning something, test your knowledge by teaching it to someone else
- gives you the opportunity to explain a topic in your own words
- participate in study groups or learn with others to bounce ideas between each other
- also holds people accountable when learning as a group
