# Binary

- binary is a number system
- we use the number system, Denary (which is base-10 or more commonly known as decimal!)
- binary is a base-2 number system (uses 0 and 1)
- computers use binary due to their integration of circuits
- these circuits are designed to allow or deny the flow of electricity in the machine/board

## Transistor

- a singular circuit
- an on/off switch for a single digit

## A Byte

- contains 8 bits or 8 binary digits (comprised of either 0 or 1)
- up to 256 different options are available in a single byte

## Kilobyte vs. Kibibyte

- being that the phrase kilo denotes 1000, we automatically tend to think KB = 1000 bytes.
- this is mainly due to how we consider storage (1TB, 2TB, etc..)
- however, 1000 KB would be using base 10 instead of base 2, which is what binary is!
- so a kibibyte is actually what is using base 2 and 1KiB is 1024 bytes
- very confusing, but we don't always remember what the base-2 equivalent is, which is why we use the base 10 in advertisements/marketing for things like storage
- circuitry which relies on base 2, binary, would be using the KiB, MiB, GiB, etc..
- this is why you see things like this (example from Apple's website)

> 1GB = 1 billion bytes and 1TB = 1 trillion bytes; actual formatted capacity less.

- they still use the SI appropriate term, but also indicate that the formatted capacity will not equal 1 trillion bytes as it would actually equal 931GiB (binary)
