## Creating a Developer-Friendly Culture

The following ideas/tips are helpful for establishing a developer-friendly culture at your company:

### Empathy and Respect

- avoid derogatory speech
- don't assume their experience/knowledge level is the same as you
- take your time and provide thoughtful responses
- give them your full attention, use eye contact

### Use "we" instead of "you"

- take responsibility as a team instead of pointing blame at one person
- don't single out one person for how *they* did it a certain way, approach it as *how can we update this to make it better*

### Pair programming and debugging

- work with your peers to review and write code
- provides opportunities to work on communication skills
- learn to give and accept criticism and feedback

### Find your stretch zone

- learn what challenges you, but is doable in time
- find tasks/challenges that you can develop and learn, but ask for help from others

### Say "I don't know"

- nobody knows everything
- it's not embarrassing to not know
- knowing when to admit you don't know speaks volumes
- admit that you don't know something, but are willing to research/learn
- provides an opportunity for both of you to learn
