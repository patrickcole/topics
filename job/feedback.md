# Feedback

- Avoid negative feedback of others
- be constructive, respectful
- avoid harsh feedback, even if you vehemently disagree with someone, respect their position but present constructive counter-points
- do not present solutions unless the other individual is requesting them
- instead of presenting solutions, ask more questions to get their perspective
- ensure that you've listened to everything they've said and understand it before you speak up
- find a way to make your message unique to the other person you are speaking with. Having a "canned", "go to" message can seem robotic and disrespectful to others
- focus on the overall situation and look for patterns, don't just narrow down to this specific feedback session
- if multiple requests for feedback are in order, don't rush through all of them at once; be methodical and effective. If you need to push others to another day, communicate that message to another individual
- if certain feedback is needed with more urgency, learn to prioritize those whom need feedback earlier than the others with less expediency
