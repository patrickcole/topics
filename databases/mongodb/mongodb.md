# MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that holds data in flat files such as documents. Each document is placed inside a collection and then each collection is located inside of a database.

These databases are not relational like MySQL, SQLServer or Postgres.

To use MongoDB with JavaScript, an external package, such as Mongoose, can be used to interface the front-end with the back-end database layer.
