# Git Commit Messages

- remember that commit messages tell those about what changes have been made and why those changes were enacted
- each commit should have a very succinct subject line that describes what the commit is about
- try to keep the subject line very short and to the point
- the subject line should start with a capitalized letter
- the subject line shouldn't be longer than 50 characters
- use the commit body to describe what the commit is in a more verbose and longer definition. Add specific examples of changes and reasons for doing so.
- this can be done via bullet points or new paragraphs entirely
- **focus more on why something was done, rather than what was done**
- body paragraphs should wrap to new lines at 72 characters long
- additional paragraphs could go into more detail rather than bullet points to provide more context
- other forms of information such as co-authors or collaborators can be listed here as well
