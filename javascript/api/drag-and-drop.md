# Drag and Drop API

API designed to handle the actual dragging of elements within the browser. There are multiple events dedicated to dragging and dropping elements.

The key is to hook into the proper events so that when a user actually drags an element and drops into the correct position, it will accept or deny that element.

There are many techniques using JavaScript to obtain the same result as this API, but this is specifically designed to work with the browser, with very little effort.
