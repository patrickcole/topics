# InnerText and InnerHTML

## innerText

- provides the ability to change the text of an element
- can use `innerText` to get current text and then append or prepend text to it
- does not parse tags when added as innerText, will convert tags such as `<` to `&lt;` and `>` to `&gt;`

## innerHTML

- adds the ability to provide raw text to an element and will parse and build any tags that are included in raw text
