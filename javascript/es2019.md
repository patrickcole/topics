# ES2019 Features

## Optional Chaining

- The content for this has been moved to [Optional Chaining](./optional-chaining.md)

## Optional Catch Binding

- if an error is not being used inside a `try/catch` block, the catch does not have to provide an Error statement or variable.

```js
let name = "Patrick Cole";
try {
  name = user.test.namefull;
} catch {}
console.log(name);
// => "Patrick Cole"
```

- useful as this would only apply the update if the `user` object was present and had the `test` and `namefull` properties. Since, they are not present and we are not catching the error, it just ignores the action.

## Pipeline Operator

- consider the following method functions:

```js
const capitalize = (str) =>  str[0].toUpperCase() + str.substring(1);
const removeSpaces = (str) => str.trim();
const repeat = (str) => `${str}, ${str}`;
```

- if we want to execute all three of these methods on a string, we could do something like this:

```js
const withoutpipe = repeat(capitalize(removeSpaces('    i am gbols    ')));
console.log(withoutpipe);
// => "I am gbols, I am gbols"
```

- now with the pipeline operator, you could do this:

```js
const withpipe = '    i am gbols    '
  |> removeSpaces
  |> capitalize
  |> repeat;
console.log(withpipe);
// => "I am gbols, I am gbols"
```

## String.trimStart and String.trimEnd

- new string trimming methods

```js
let message = "     Welcome to LogRocket      ";
message.trimStart();
// => "Welcome to LogRocket      "
message.trimEnd();
// => "     Welcome to LogRocket";
```

## Object.entries

- create an array from object

```js
const devs = {
  gbols: 5,
  andrew: 3,
  kelani: 10,
  dafe: 8,
};
const arrOfDevs = Object.entries(devs);
/*
=> [
  ["gbols", 5],
  ["andrew", 3],
  ["kelani", 10],
  ["dafe", 8]
]
*/
```

- at this point, a filter method could be run on this array to filter out those with a score of 7 or higher, etc.

## Object.fromEntries

- converts an array back to an object

```js
console.log(Object.fromEntries(arrOfDevs));
/*
=> {
  gbols: 5,
  andrew: 3,
  kelani: 10,
  dafe: 8,
}
```

## Array.flat

- can flatten an array based on argument for levels to flatten to
- by adding `Infinity` as argument, array will flatten until no arrays left

```js
let sampleArray = [
  ['Javascript', 'NodeJs', ['ReactJs', ['ExpressJs', 'PostgresSql']]],
  ['Ruby', 'Jest', ['Rails', ['JQuery', 'MySql']]],
  ['PHP', 'Lumen', ['Angular', 'NgRx']]
];
let flattenedArray = Array.flat(Infinity);
console.log(flattenedArray);
/*
=>
[
  "JavaScript",
  "NodeJs",
  "ReactJs",
  "ExpressJs",
  "PostgresSql",
  "Ruby",
  "Jest",
  "Rails",
  "JQuery",
  "MySql",
  "PHP",
  "Lumen",
  "Angular",
  "NgRx"
]
*/
```

## Array.flatMap

- calls the map method and flat method with a depth of 1
